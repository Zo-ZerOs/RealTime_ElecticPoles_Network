🌐 Radio Transmitting Device: from the idea of Internet of Things (IoT) -> crafting an equipment, which driven by the Arduino language, designed to transfer data via Radio Transmission using the ESP32 Module

The Kamnoetvidya Science Academy (KVIS) is a part of the Pawaangchan Project initiated by the Forest Plantation and Environmental Systems Institute, PTT Public Company Limited. It is located in Payubnai Subdistrict, Wangchan District, Rayong Province. Every student and staff member at the Kamnertvit School faces challenges of frequent power outages, especially during heavy rainfall or storms. A survey conducted among the public and the network of communities in Rayong Province revealed that power outages are a common issue faced by the local residents in various areas. Moreover, each time a power outage occurs, it takes a considerable amount of time for the power to be restored to normal. This is due to the fact that the repair process of the regional power distribution system only begins once a report of the outage is received.

After receiving a report, the power company's personnel locate the problematic transmission poles by relying on the outage location as a reference point. This process is delayed as the small-sized transmission poles lack measuring equipment or any means to send signals to the regional power network. Consequently, the resolution process is hampered by this delay.

Recognizing these challenges, the project team identified the need for a solution. As a result, they conceived the idea of developing a real-time monitoring device for the transmission poles within the network. This device is designed to continuously send information about the transmission poles to relevant parties, enabling swift identification and resolution of issues. Additionally, the system includes a function to measure the incline of the transmission poles, allowing for the assessment of their condition. The project team plans to make this information accessible to the local residents, providing immediate access to network issues in cases of power outages or disruptions. This will be achieved through coordination with the regional power network, ensuring the prompt communication of information.
